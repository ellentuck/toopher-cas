    <!-- Simple Spring Bean to define Toopher MFA requirements for different services.
         If you wish to define MFA requirements elsewhere (e.g. in Service Attributes),
         implement the com.toopher.integrations.cas.web.flow.PrincipalLoaResolver interface
         and set levelOfAssuranceManager.serviceLoaResolver to an instance of that bean
         in levelOfAssurance.xml -->
